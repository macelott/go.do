# Soto: *Organization, your way.*


*Soto is a one-stop solution for living your best life through purposefully scheduling where you put in your time. It allows users with different preferences to experience scheduling the way they want to on the fly, incorporating common scheduling tools like todo lists and calendars beautifully into one location.*

#### Design and Methodology
We are going to focus on creating an app with various ways for viewing and interacting with todo lists. For example, we would allow a user to simply view their todos in a basic list format without too much information, or we would allow them to switch to a more complex interactive experience; such as a calendar. We'll be researching ways to make organization a fun and pleasant experience for users and will be incorporating features such as keeping track of progress towards completing a task with subtasks, setting different importance levels on tasks etc. All of these features available on one platform will allow a user to keep all their information in one place and not have to keep switching from app to app which can be confusing and annoying. 

#### Technical Details
The app will combine a simple user interface with a robust experience built with **AngularJS**. We have learnt about different design techniques throughout Webware and we want to emphasize this in our project. Our reasoning behind using Angular is that weâ€™re very interested in responsive (and modular) user interface and design principles. We believe that Angular address a lot of the inflexible and static parts of HTML and want to use this project as a way to take a deep dive into this framework. Additionally, this project takes into account different user preferences and would allow us to learn more about developing for different types of people. We want this app to be highly flexible, minimal and extremely user-friendly.
